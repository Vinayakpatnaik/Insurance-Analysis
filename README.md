# Insurance-Analysis

### Aim
This repository aims to create a basic report using the Power BI tool for analyzing the trends in a company's insurance data and gaining insights.

### Problem Statment
An Insurance company wants to visualize the financial performance of claims made against the policies. The data given contains the information about claims processed in the month of January and February. The aim is to plot visualisations which will provide a quick overview of claims data to the leadership.

### Dataset info
The data consists of 1000 individual claims. The most important variable of interest is fraud_reported. This variable is labelled 1 if a certain claim is reported to be fraudulent and 0 otherwise. Each claim in the data is described by 40 different attributes, which are represented as columns. We can divide the descriptive attributes into four main categories: the insured person, the policy of that person, description of the incident and characteristics of the car which is involved in the incident.
